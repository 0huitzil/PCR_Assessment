# Assessment (math modeller)

The request function is found on the file Py_Segments.py under the name segLengths. This function takes three parameters (S1, S2, L) and returns a list containing the segment lengths whose total length equals L. 

The file Py_Test.py contains a table (in the form of a dataframe) with a series of test values for the function segLengths. Running the file prints this dataframe, which can also be found in the testTable.xlsx file. 

The mathematics describing the algorithm used in the segLengths function are briefly described in the Assessment_Maths.pdf file.
